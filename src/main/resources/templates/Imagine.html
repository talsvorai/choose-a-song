<div class="song-title">Imagine by John Lennon</div>
<div class="lyrics">
    Imagine there's no heaven<br>
    It's easy if you try<br>
    No hell below us<br>
    Above us, only sky<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Livin' for today<br>
    Ah<br><br>
    Imagine there's no countries<br>
    It isn't hard to do<br>
    Nothing to kill or die for<br>
    And no religion, too<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Livin' life in peace<br>
    You<br><br>
    You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will be as one<br><br>
    Imagine no possessions<br>
    I wonder if you can<br>
    No need for greed or hunger<br>
    A brotherhood of man<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Sharing all the world<br>
    You<br><br>
    You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will live as one
