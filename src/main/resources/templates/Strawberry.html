<div class="song-title">Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles</div>
<div class="lyrics">
    Let me take you down<br>
    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br><br>
    Nothing is real<br>
    And nothing to get hung about<br>
    Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
    Living is easy with eyes closed<br>
    Misunderstanding all you see<br>
    It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out<br>
    It doesn't matter much to me<br><br>
    Let me take you down<br>
    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br><br>
    Nothing is real<br>
    And nothing to get hung about<br>
    Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
    No one I think is in my tree<br>
    I mean, it must be high or low<br>
    That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright<br>
    That is, I think it's not too bad<br><br>
    Let me take you down<br>
    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br><br>
    Nothing is real<br>
    And nothing to get hung about<br>
    Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
    Always, no sometimes, think it's me<br>
    But you know, I know when it's a dream<br>
    I think I know, I mean a yes<br>
    But it's all wrong<br>
    That is, I think I disagree<br><br>
    Let me take you down<br>
    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields<br><br>
    Nothing is real<br>
    And nothing to get hung about<br>
    Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
    Strawberry fields forever<br><br>
    Strawberry fields forever
